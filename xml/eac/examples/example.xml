	<!--REQUIRED
	Whereas the control element describes the record, the cpfDescription is a container for everything describing the person.
	Usually there is only one cpfDescription per person, but more than one is possible using the multipleIdentities element.
	You might have two different cpfDescription elements, for instance, if the person has a pseudonym or other acquired identity, for which you want to have two separate sets of names and other information.
	In our field, perhaps "Chrysostom" for John, Archbishop of Constantinople, or "The Interpreter" for Theodore of Mopsuestia would be good candidates for separate cpfDescription elements.
	You might also use multiple identities in a single record if multiple people share a collaborative identity/pseudonym (perhaps "Ephrem Graecus" or the generic "Isaac"?).
	For more explanation and examples of multiple identities, see http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/eac/cpf/tagLibrary/cpfTagLibrary.html#d1e4966 and http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/eac/cpf/tagLibrary/cpfTagLibrary.html#d1e224 -->

				The nameEntry element contains the parts of a particular name form.

				Script codes must be in the ISO 15924 format.
				You can look up scriptCodes at http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html
				The most common scripts we're using are "Latn" for Latin, "Syrc" for Syriac, "Syrj" for West Syriac, "Syre" for East Syriac, "Arab" for Arabic, and "Grek" for Greek.
				
				Use the transliteration attribute to specify which transliteration is being used for the name (if the name is a transliteration).
				The transliteration value should be standardized (i.e., always the same value for a particular transliteration system.
				
				Use xml:lang to indicate the language. 
				The xml:lang value must be in ISO-639-2 format.
				Look up language codes at http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

			For corporate bodies, this is the date of establishment/dissolution.-->

				<!--OPTIONAL
				The dateRange element lets you specify a period of time like "306-373 C.E." or  "Jan. 25-Feb. 27."
				Just use fromDate for the first date and toDate for the second date.-->
					<fromDate notBefore="0300" notAfter="0315" standardDate="0306">306</fromDate>
					<!--REQUIRED if using dateRange
					EAC has some great ways of handling dates.
					DATE ATTRIBUTES
						You can use any of the following three attributes for a date element, or a combination of them.
						The standardDate attribute is where you can point to a single, machine-readable date.
						The notBefore attribute allows you to specify a terminus post quem.
						The notAfter attribute is a terminus ante quem.
					NUMBER FORMATS FOR DATE ATTRIBUTES
						Dates that are attribute values (values for notBefore, notAfter, or standardDate) should be in ISO 8601 format.
						You can see details for ISO 8601 format at http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime 
						In brief, the format is YYYY-MM-DD (four-digit year, 2-digit month and day), but month and day are not required.
						For 3-digit years, like 373, make sure to include a 0 on the front!
					BC DATES
						For BC dates, note that the year 0000 is 1 BC (since there is no year 0 between 1 BC and AD 1.
						Therefore, to put a BC date, add 1 to it and put a minus sign in front of it (25 BC becomes -0025).
						See http://www.fact-index.com/i/is/iso_8601.html
					HUMAN READABLE DATE VALUES
						The human-readable date that will be displayed is the value between <fromDate> and </fromDate> (in this case, "306").
						You can express that date however you would like - "306," "AD 306," "306 CE," etc.-->
					<toDate standardDate="0373-06-09">June 9, 373</toDate>
				</dateRange>
				<!--If you don't have both birth and death dates, you can give the date(s) you have (birth/death, fl., etc.).
				I think the type of date given should be specified with localType.
				So an author with just a death date would be
					<existDates>
						<date standardDate="0373" localType="death">373</date>
					<existDates>
				An author with a floruit in the 2nd half of the 5th cent. could be given the following existDates:
					<existDates>
						<dateRange localType="floruit">
							<fromDate standardDate="0450" localType="floruit">450</fromDate>
							<toDate standardDate="499" localType="floruit">499</toDate>
						</dateRange>
					<existDates>
				If, on the other hand, you'd like to give several dates that help establish the existDates of the person, you can use multiple date elements, or even mix date and dateRange elements inside a dateSet.
				For example,
					<existDates>
						<dateSet>
							<date standardDate="0451" localType="floruit">451</date>
							<date notAfter="0473" localType="floruit">473 or earlier</date>
							<dateRange localType="floruit">
								<fromDate standardDate="0481" localType="floruit">481</fromDate>
								<toDate standardDate="0497" localType="floruit">497</toDate>
							</dateRange>
						</dateSet>

			<!--REQUIRED if you use more than one function element
			This is a container for multiple function elements.
			You can still use this even if you only have one function.-->
				<function>
				<!--OPTIONAL
				The function element is a very flexible element that can be used for describing "a function, activity, role, or purpose performed or manifested by the entity being described."
				We might use this for describing a person's ecclesiastical role, even if laity.
				We can also use it for describing things a person does besides their occupation.
				Note that occupation is a separate element.
				Also note that if we want to link the function to another entity - e.g., this person was the scribe of a particular manuscript - we should use the functionRelation element under relations.-->
